== How do I build JavaCL / ScalaCL / OpenCL4Java ==

Please read [Build]

== How do I run JavaCL Demos ? ==

You can launch the Particles and HardwareReport JavaCL Demos from the Java Web Start links from the front page.

If you've built JavaCL from the sources, you can also launch the demos directly in command line :

  * Install JOGL properly as described on the [Build] page
  * Go to libraries/OpenCL/Demos/target
  * Launch your demo :
{{{
java -cp javacl-demos-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar com.nativelibs4java.opencl.JOGLTest
}}}
  (in Maveneese, "shaded" means "with all dependencies included" so there's only one JAR to put in the classpath, JOGL issues left apart)

== What demos are available ? ==

You can find a list of demos in the source tree :
[http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/source/browse/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/Demos/src/main/java/com/nativelibs4java/opencl/demos]

For now here are the graphical demos :
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.HardwareReport
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.MandelbrotDemo
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.ParticlesDemo
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.SobelFilterDemo (path of the image input file is hardcoded in the source, easy to change)

And some small headless demos as well :
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.ParallelRandomDemo
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.VectorAdd
