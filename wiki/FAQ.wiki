== Which platforms does JavaCL support ? ==

Please read [HardwareRequirements].

== How do I build JavaCL / ScalaCL / OpenCL4Java ==

Please read the [Build] page.

== How do I run JavaCL Demos ? ==

You can launch the Particles and HardwareReport JavaCL Demos from the Java Web Start links from the front page.

If you've built JavaCL from the sources, you can also launch the demos directly in command line :

  * Install JOGL properly as described on the [Build] page
  * Go to libraries/OpenCL/Demos/target
  * Launch your demo (read "What demos are available ?" on this page and pick the right demo class) :
{{{
java -cp javacl-demos-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar com.nativelibs4java.opencl.JOGLTest
}}}
  (in Maveneese, "shaded" means "with all dependencies included" so there's only one JAR to put in the classpath, JOGL issues left apart)

== What demos are available ? ==

You can find a list and the source code of demos in the source tree :
[http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/source/browse/trunk/libraries/OpenCL/Demos/src/main/java/com/nativelibs4java/opencl/demos]

For now here are the graphical demos :
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.HardwareReport
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.MandelbrotDemo
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.ParticlesDemo
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.SobelFilterDemo (path of the image input file is hardcoded in the source, easy to change)

And some small headless demos as well :
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.ParallelRandomDemo
  * com.nativelibs4java.opencl.demos.VectorAdd

== How do I write and call OpenCL kernels from Java ==

Please read [CallingOpenCLKernelsFromJava] and look at the demos source code.

== Does JavaCL support OpenCL type XXX for kernel arguments ? ==

JavaCL supports all OpenCL types, please see [UnderstandOpenCLKernelArguments] for type mapping details.

== How do I use buffers / images in JavaCL ==

Please read [ReadFromAndWriteToBuffersAndImages]

== My question is not here... How can I get some help ? ==

JavaCL has a [http://groups.google.com/group/nativelibs4java user group / mailing-list] : you can search in its archive to find similar past questions or post a new message, we'll try to help the best we can.
