#summary Various JavaCL learning materials available on the net or in libraries

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Official tutorials =
  * Simple [GettingStarted Getting Started] tutorial : will guide you through calling OpenCL kernels with and without the [JavaCLGenerator JavaCL Generator]
  * [http://ochafik.com/blog/?p=501 Write your first OpenCL Discrete Fourier Transform with JavaCL in 15 minutes] : uses the old JNA version of JavaCL (see the [MigratingFromJNAToBridJ migration page])

= Books =
  * [http://www.manning.com/scarpino2/ OpenCL in Action] is clearly the best OpenCL reference and hands-on guide out there, packed with amazing real-world examples ! (and it even covers JavaCL)
