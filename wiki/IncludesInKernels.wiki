#summary How to include files from OpenCL kernels in JavaCL

In C (and in OpenCL's C dialect), it is possible to include C files into a source file.

This is done by the C preprocessor and requires a list of include paths, which usually contain the current directory of the process.

JavaCL provides two ways to include files easily from your OpenCL kernels :
  * Any Java resource can be included without any further work. Say the file `MyCLLib/someHeader.h` is visible in the classpath (maybe inside a JAR, for instance), then the `#include "MyCLLib/someHeader.h` statement in any OpenCL kernel passed to JavaCL will just work as expected !
  * `CLProgram.addInclude(path)` adds a directory or an URL to the list of include paths

Additionally, the JavaCL Project contains a new library called LibCL, which aims at gathering useful includes for OpenCL kernels. It is bundled as a plain old JAR and contains resources.
