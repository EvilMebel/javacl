#summary How to debug OpenCL kernels using JavaCL

Please read this great blog post from Igor Suhorukov to get started

[http://suhorukov.blogspot.com/2011/12/opencl-kernel-debugging-for-java-host.html OpenCL kernel debugging for java host code].

Note that following Igor's post, a new "debug" setting was added to JavaCL to ease up debugging :
`JAVACL_DEBUG=1` (or the equivalent Java property `javacl.debug=true`). It will print out the process id, give hints on how to run gdb and will insert the `-O0 -g` compiler options into all the kernels (and will force-disable any conflicting optimization option such as `-O3` or `-g:none`).
