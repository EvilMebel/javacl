#summary Instructions to build JavaCL / ScalaCL / OpenCL4Java

JavaCL, ScalaCL and OpenCL4Java can be built from sources.

  * First, [http://maven.apache.org/download.html install Maven].
  * Then, install [http://kenai.com/projects/jogl/pages/Home JOGL 2.x] if you want automatic tests to pass. 
  _This is tricky_ : you need to extract *some* of the files from the [http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/nightly/ archive that matches your platform] to the extension directory of your JRE (jre6/lib/ext), but not all of them (otherwise JOGL will present you black screens without explanation).
  Typically, you'll need :
    * jogl.all.jar
    * gluegen-rt.jar
    * gluegen-rt.dll / .so / .dylib
    * nativewindow.all.jar
    * nativewindow_awt.dll / .so / .dylib
    * nativewindow_jvm.dll / .so / .dylib
  Yeah, that sucks (hope they'll make an up-to-date Maven repository available soon...).
  * Checkout [http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/source/browse/#svn/trunk/libraries nativelibs4java files] :
    {{{
svn checkout http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries nativelibs4java
cd nativelibs4java
cd OpenCL
}}}
  * *Optional, not advised* : Regenerate the low-level bindings (you'll have to edit the autogenerated files after the generation to avoid regressions, use some SVN diff for that. The current SVN version was generated by bits on three platforms) :
    {{{
mvn com.jnaerator:maven-jnaerator-plugin:jnaerate
}}}
  * Compile and package OpenCL4Java/JavaCL/ScalaCL/Demos/BLAS in one command (Maven is not all bad) :
    {{{
mvn package
}}}
  (note that you can skip tests by appending "-Dmaven.test.skip=true" to that command line in case one test prevents you from creating the target JARs)
