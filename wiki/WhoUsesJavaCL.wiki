== `OpenWorm` ==

[http://www.openworm.org/ OpenWorm] is an ambitious life-simulation project that tackles "the greatest puzzle of our time - what are all the events that happen inside a living brain?" (to achieve that long-term goal, it starts with a not-so-simple worm simulation that deals with neural networks, chemistry and physics simulation...)

It [http://www.openworm.org/index.html#/tech uses JavaCL] to perform GPU-powered simulations.

== `Encog` ==

"[http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog Encog] is an advanced neural network and machine learning framework."

There appears to be [http://www.heatonresearch.com/wiki/JavaCL experimentations with JavaCL] (and other bindings) to perform GPGPU.

== `Calx (Clojure)` ==

[https://github.com/ztellman/calx Calx] is an idiomatic Clojure wrapper for OpenCL.

It uses JavaCL underneath.

== JavaCL Parallel Primitives ==

The [http://gitorious.org/javaclpp/pages/Home JavaCL Parallel Primitives] (from [http://kazocsaba.blogspot.com/ Kazó Csaba], who also [http://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/CreditsAndLicense contributes to JavaCL]) provides reduction and scan utilities that go beyond [Goodies those provided in JavaCL], and more...

== `ScalaCL` ==

[http://code.google.com/p/scalacl/ ScalaCL] (BSD-licensed) is an optimizing Scala compiler plugin + GPU-backed collections.

It uses JavaCL, which is still accessible directly if needed.
